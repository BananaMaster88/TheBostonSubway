      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p id="box">Subways are a very large innovation in modern American society that has changed the ways of transportation in urban areas. The Boston subway was both the spark of efficient, underground transportation in America as well as one of the nation's greatest inconveniences. At a price range of about $121.6 million dollars in today's money to construct, the subway jumped up its value to approximately $5.2 billion (including investment), even though each ticket was only $2.40 ($0.05 back then). The Boston subway is a reminder of the negative, depressing events that took place in the progression of American technology. From accidental explosions to creative homocide, the Boston Subway was like a replica of the Boston Massacre.</p>
  <h1>Timeline</h1>
      <h3>September 1, 1887</h3>
      <p>On this day, the first segement of the Boston Subway opens. This model is built based off the first subway in London, and was designed as an improvement to its flaws and strengths. However, a devestating history awaits ahead...</p>
</br>
<h3>December 15, 1887</h3>
<p>On this date, the Boston Subway fails for the first time. The reasons behind why are unrecorded.</p>
<br>
<h3>March 4, 1897</h3>
<p>After the previous issue with the subway itself was resolved, a new one is revealed. Rather than a difficulty occuring in the cart, a gas leak during construction in the tunnel system kills many workers by explosion and leaves about fifty people injured.</p>

</br>
</br>
<h3>July 24, 1901</h3>
<p>After the tragic disaster was presumably assured to never occur again, the subway spikes in popularity. This decreases the traffic immensely, which was believed to cause social changes in the city.</p>
</br>
<h3>June 21, 1903</h3>
<p>Many of Boston's historic landmarks are obliterated by the innovation on the Boston subway. One example was the unearthing of 900 graves from the 1750's.</p>
</br>
<h3>October 27, 1904</h3>
<p>Another subway in New York is inspired by the Boston Subway; the 2nd subway to open in the United States.</p>
</br>
<h3>December 1904</h3>
<p>As another tunnel is added to the subway, it extends underwater, making it the longest underwater railroad track in the world. The purpose of this tunnel was to connect the subway to East Boston.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>June 6, 1906</h3>
      <p>As foreshadowed, yet another fire hazard found its way into the subway due to a broken utility pipe that bursted and ignited a fire from a spark between one of the cart wheels and the track, leading to several injured being dragged out of the tunnels to safety. This developed a high fear of electrocution.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>December 10, 1910</h3>
    <p>John F. Donahue commits suicide by jumping in front of the moving subway. The subway had now obtained a popular reputation of death and destructon.</p>
  </br>
  <h3>June 17, 1912</h3>
  <p>Boston Subway workers go on strike for union recognition.</p>
</br>
<h3>July 21, 1919</h3>
<p>Subway workers strike for an eight-hour work day and higher wages. These requests are understandable due to the hard work, required intelligence, and danger of their jobs.</p>

</br>
</br>
<h3>December 23, 1921</h3>
<p>The last major failue of subway leaves its mark, as yet another explosion in the main power line devestates the Christmas holiday.</p>
      <h1>Effect</h1>
      <p>While the subway seemed to have caused more issues than optimistic advancements into the future, it still did have its benefits. For one, it offered a way for effecient transportation without the interuppting the Earth's Entropy. Not only that, but it also carried 2.8 million people daily. In conclusion, many of the things that seem old and plain that we take for granted were once seen as a huge innovation in technology, which may have costed lives in the making.</p>
